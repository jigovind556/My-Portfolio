- central ( main section)
        + is a mobile which has apps(which are my projects) - camera app ,message app, about me ,github website link, linkedin website link, leet code website link, my automate project link, chess app .
        + these apps are of three types 
                     *  included in the own website (camera app ,messaging app,et.c)
                     *  my own website but hosted elsewhere (automate,chess game,et.c)
